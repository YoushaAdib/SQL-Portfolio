# IDA/IPS Data Set - SQL EDA 
Read IDS/IPS dataset is really hard to come by. I have been using CSE-CIC-IDS2018 (https://registry.opendata.aws/cse-cic-ids2018/) Dataset from UNB at Canada. I have downloaded the dataset from AWS-S3 Bucket and loaded to my personal OCI Based Oracle 21c - ADW. 
**Approx Database Size:** 4 GB with 4.2 Million Rows
